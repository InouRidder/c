# RAM stands for Random Access Memory
Running programs are stored in RAM
Otherwise stored on hard drive (Long Term! or solid state drive)

# transistors are the 0 1 representation of electricity turned on or off - they are FINITE! Computers will try to represent as closely as possibly the truth of a computations but can only get as close as their hardware allows

Float exact computation either to a large number or a small number can not be exactly precise, because the amount of transistors of a computer is finite hence its representation of a number can never be truely exact it can only be very close to the right answer. Hence, if you look at the decimal point of computation 2.0 / 10.0 you get not exactly 2.0~ but something like 2.0000000045983023 which is the closest your computer can get with the finite amount of hardware to exactly represent the number of 0.2




# COMPILING

- preprocessing (in c: things denoted with a # are preprocessed, setting the order or process) - fetch all the included files


- compiling is compiling code to computer understandable code. c gets compiled to assembler, the CPU or central processing unit only understands assembly.

- Assembling (going from ASSEMBLY to binary). Taking all the assembly references to the 10101 that are saved in assembly code's memory
